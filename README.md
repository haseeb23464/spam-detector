#pip install pandas scikit-learn
# Import necessary libraries
# Load the dataset (you can download the 'spam.csv' from Kaggle or any other source)
# Replace the path with the correct path to your dataset
# Clean the text data (you can expand this step to remove more unwanted characters)
# Split the data into features (X) and target (y)
# Split the dataset into training and testing set
# Vectorize the text data: Convert text messages to numerical values using TF-IDF
# Train a Naive Bayes Classifier on the training data
# Make predictions on the test data
# Evaluate the model's performance
# Display a more detailed classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)
# Display a confusion matrix to see how many messages were correctly/incorrectly classification
# Plot the confusion matrix
# the end
